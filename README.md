## ðŸ§© Tips & Techniques

1. **Use hierarchy** in design (half adder blocks).
2. Minimize series transistors in critical paths for better speed.
3. Use **minimum-sized inverters** for buffering non-critical nodes.
4. Keep **symmetric layout** for matched delay paths.
5. Carefully handle **parasitic loading** by checking RC extraction.
6. Always check **input pin drive strength** during simulation.
